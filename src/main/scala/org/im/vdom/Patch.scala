/**
 * A Patch holds "difference" information that can be applied
 * to another object (the target) to make it look like another
 * (the source) object. The "difference" information must
 * be interpreted for each backend environment that the patch 
 * is targeting.
 * 
 * You can create patches either from diffing two virtual dom
 * trees or you can just manually create the patches and compose
 * them using a sequence or `andThen` essentially creating a
 * patch stream or template language of DOM "updates."
 * 
 * It is quite passible that another layer of abstraction creates
 * patches directly as an intermediate "language."
